            <p class="text">It doesn't hurts to start in your own home. If you practice Yoga in the comfort of your home, why not have your child follow along. You could show them a few of your favorite poses, or just have them watch. They’ll be impressed by your skill, and this could be a great parent child bonding moment. There are also quite a few Yoga for kids studios sprouting up around the country. Karma Kids Yoga in New York in particular is paving the way for Yoga kids to grow. They’ve coined the term “play yoga” which allows children to enjoy yoga on their own level, and gain body control and mind connection.

<!-- Reminder >> Creative Brief
Take the Creative Proposal/Creative Brief template that is linked in the Class Materials section in Blackboard and fill it out twice for two different potential clients for the Midterm project. Use your imagination to describe a client and their ideal customer or target audience for the site you are designing for them.

TO TURN IN THIS ASSIGNMENT:

Attach your two text documents to the assignment here in Blackboard.

The assignment is due by Sunday, October 21st, 5pm. Assignments turned in late cannot receive full credit. 


Assignment
Midterm Project
Create a 3-page "fan" website for a fictional client (based on our “five topics” in-class exercise).

I'll be looking for the following:
(1) A Creative Brief (see Class Materials Section)
(2) At least three HTML pages (including your index.html page)
(3) A consistent design (using one external style sheet) to change your default colors & use at least one google font or downloaded font
(4) A consistent navigation on every page that links to every page in the site. (Hint: use the same unordered list inside a “nav” tag on all of your pages).
(5) A one-column layout through your site (hint: use the "width" and "margin" properties in CSS for the body selector)
(6) A multi-column layout somewhere on your site (this includes two-column layouts)
(7) Appropriate citations (i.e. link to where you got anything you didn’t make yourself)
(8) You've uploaded your work to your GitHub Repo and have provided two links (one for the code and one for the live site).
(9) You're presentation of this work in class (on Monday Oct. 29th).


TO SUBMIT: 
(1) Copy and paste your two midterm site links in the comments section below(Please test both your links in a browser before submitting.)
(2) Attach your "fan site" Creative Brief file.

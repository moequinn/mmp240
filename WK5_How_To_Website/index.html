        <p>First, TURN THE LIGHT SWITCH OFF. Now, if it's a lamp with a cord and plug then, UNPLUG THE LIGHT. Then, double check if the light switch is off. Then double check that it's unplugged. If you've ever been shocked, you'll know why I repeated those steps. LEARN from my mistakes here people! Ha-ha the devise we're making is plastic so you're not likely to be shocked even if the power is on but it's better to be safe than sorry.</p>

        <p>Now, take an empty water bottle. The heftier ones are better for this application. Remove the cap, the label and the little ring around the neck that breaks when you take the lid off.</p>
